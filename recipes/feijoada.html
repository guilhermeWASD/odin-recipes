        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            Wednesday and Saturday are consecrated Feijoada days for Brazilians! Its origin is still much debated, but it is assumed that the dish is an adaptation of the Portuguese stew, since this type of recipe was very common in Europe (such as Puchero in Spain and Cassoulet in France). The Brazilian version is made with black beans, various cuts of pork and beef, onion and garlic, and is “religiously” accompanied by rice, sautéed cabbage, farofa, crackling, orange and vinaigrette.
